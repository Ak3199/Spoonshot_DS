Q1 - This code implements a recommendation system, which returns a ranked list based on the article that has been provided. The basic idea behind this implementation is that, when traversing through the article the similarity of the words present in the article to the words present in the ingreideint list would decide how relevant is the food item to this particular article and subsequently allot some points for the ranking. 
This code also involves some sort of NLP, as we are going through the synonyms of the words and its possible variations.
